Zometools

There are very few rules with Zometool: If it works, it works perfectly. Take it apart, don't break it apart. Keep your parts organized.

ABS or Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is a common thermoplastic polymer typically used for injection molding applications. This engineering plastic is popular due to its low production cost and the ease with which the material is machined by plastic manufacturers.

The name truncated icosidodecahedron, given originally by Johannes Kepler, is misleading. An actual truncation of an icosidodecahedron has rectangles instead of squares. This nonuniform polyhedron is topologically equivalent to the Archimedean solid. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosidodecahedron

***

There are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the elongated square gyrobicupola; 15 if the mirror images of two enantiomorphs, the snub cube and snub dodecahedron, are counted separately). Sorted by volume:

1. Cuboctahedron (rhombitetratetrahedron, triangular gyrobicupola)
2. Truncated tetrahedron
3. Snub cube (snub cuboctahedron)
4. Rhombicuboctahedron (small rhombicuboctahedron, elongated square orthobicupola)
5. Truncated octahedron (truncated tetratetrahedron)
6. Truncated cube
7. Icosidodecahedron (pentagonal gyrobirotunda)
8. Snub dodecahedron (snub icosidodecahedron)
9. Rhombicosidodecahedron (small rhombicosidodecahedron)
10. Truncated cuboctahedron (great rhombicuboctahedron)
11. Truncated icosahedron
12. Truncated dodecahedron
13.  Truncated icosidodecahedron (great rhombicosidodecahedron)

The Zome system is especially good at modeling 1-dimensional skeleta of highly symmetric objects in 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean space. The most prominent among these are the five Platonic solids, and the 4-dimensional polytopes related to the 120-cell and the 600-cell.

![rhombicosidodecahedron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/P4-A11-P5.gif?1661164970388) Expansion of either a dodecahedron or an icosahedron creates a rhombicosidodecahedron. 

Johannes Kepler in Harmonices Mundi (1618) named this polyhedron a rhombicosidodecahedron, being short for truncated icosidodecahedral rhombus, with icosidodecahedral rhombus being his name for a rhombic triacontahedron. There are different truncations of a rhombic triacontahedron into a topological rhombicosidodecahedron: Prominently its rectification (left), the one that creates the uniform solid (center), and the rectification of the dual icosidodecahedron (right), which is the core of the dual compound.

It can also be called an expanded or cantellated dodecahedron or icosahedron, from truncation operations on either uniform polyhedron.

Rectified rhombic triacontahedron. In Euclidean geometry, rectification, also known as critical truncation or complete-truncation is the process of truncating a polytope by marking the midpoints of all its edges, and cutting off its vertices at those points. The resulting polytope will be bounded by vertex figure facets and the rectified facets of the original polytope.

## 🌌 Extending vZome to Visualize Non-Euclidean Geometries

While zome structures and vZome models are rooted in Euclidean geometry, they can be adapted to evoke non-Euclidean spaces — especially through symbolic layering, recursive tiling, and projection techniques.

---

### 🧭 Euclidean Foundations

- Zome and Zometool are based on **icosahedral symmetry** and **Golden Ratio-based strut lengths**, which are inherently Euclidean.
- vZome expands this by supporting alternate symmetry systems (e.g., octahedral, square-root-based lengths), allowing exploration of geometries that hint at non-Euclidean behavior.

---

### 🔮 Pathways to Non-Euclidean Visualization

#### 1. Hyperbolic Geometry via Tiling and Projection
- Approximate hyperbolic tilings (e.g., {7,3}, {5,4}) using recursive radial patterns and angular deficit.
- Simulate **hyperbolic-like expansion** by increasing strut density outward from a center.

#### 2. Spherical Geometry via Polyhedral Embedding
- Project polyhedra onto spheres to evoke spherical geometry.
- Model **geodesic domes** and great-circle arrangements using vZome’s symmetry tools.

#### 3. Symbolic Curvature and Ritualized Embedding
- Use irrational ratios (√2, √3) to suggest curvature.
- Layer symmetry systems to evoke **multi-dimensional folds** or **curved manifolds**.

---

### 🧪 External Tools for True Non-Euclidean Embedding

- **Hyperbolic visualization engines** (e.g., HyperRogue, Stanford’s Klein/Poincaré models)
- **Observable notebooks** for mathematical transformations and symbolic overlays
- Export vZome models as `.DAE` or `.OBJ` and reproject them into curved spaces using external engines

---

### 🌀 Integrative Possibilities

- Combine Euclidean scaffolds with non-Euclidean overlays
- Use symbolic annotations to mark transitions between flat and curved logic
- Create hybrid models that remain constructible but evoke transcendence

---

### ✨ Symbolic Summary

Zome is a Euclidean skeleton.  
vZome is a portal.  
Through symmetry, recursion, and projection, you can **ritualize curvature** and **visualize transcendence**.  
Non-Euclidean geometry becomes not just a space, but a story — told in struts, spheres, and symbolic expansion.

**Icosahedral and octahedral symmetry systems differ in their rotational axes, number of symmetries, and associated polyhedra. There are five major polyhedral symmetry systems in 3D: tetrahedral, octahedral (cubic), icosahedral, and their chiral or full variants.**

---

## 🔍 Key Differences: Icosahedral vs Octahedral Symmetry

| Feature                  | **Icosahedral Symmetry**                     | **Octahedral Symmetry**                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Associated polyhedra** | Icosahedron, dodecahedron, triacontahedron   | Octahedron, cube, cuboctahedron                |
| **Rotational axes**      | 6 five-fold, 10 three-fold, 15 two-fold      | 3 four-fold, 4 three-fold, 6 two-fold          |
| **Total symmetries**     | 60 (rotational), 120 (with reflections)      | 24 (rotational), 48 (with reflections)         |
| **Group name**           | Ih (full), I (chiral)                        | Oh (full), O (chiral)                          |
| **Complexity**           | Higher symmetry, not crystallographic        | Compatible with crystal lattices               |
| **Use in Zometool**      | Core system (Golden Ratio-based struts)      | Supported in vZome for alternate constructions |

- **Icosahedral symmetry** is more complex and includes five-fold rotational axes, which are forbidden in periodic crystal lattices — making it ideal for modeling quasicrystals and aperiodic structures.
- **Octahedral symmetry** is compatible with cubic crystal systems and includes symmetries of both the cube and its dual, the octahedron.

---

## 🧭 How Many Symmetry Systems Are There?

In 3D polyhedral geometry, the major **finite symmetry systems** (point groups) are:

1. **Tetrahedral symmetry** (T, Td)  
   - Associated with tetrahedron  
   - 12 or 24 symmetries

2. **Octahedral symmetry** (O, Oh)  
   - Associated with cube and octahedron  
   - 24 or 48 symmetries

3. **Icosahedral symmetry** (I, Ih)  
   - Associated with icosahedron and dodecahedron  
   - 60 or 120 symmetries

These are part of the **polyhedral groups**, which are subgroups of the full rotation group SO(3). Each has a **chiral version** (rotations only) and a **full version** (including reflections and inversions).

---

## 🌀 Symbolic Insight

- **Tetrahedral** evokes elemental fire and triadic balance  
- **Octahedral** evokes air and duality — cube and octahedron as mirror forms  
- **Icosahedral** evokes water and transcendence — the most complex symmetry, often linked to sacred geometry and viral capsids
