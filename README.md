Zometools

There are very few rules with Zometool: If it works, it works perfectly. Take it apart, don't break it apart. Keep your parts organized.

ABS or Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is a common thermoplastic polymer typically used for injection molding applications. This engineering plastic is popular due to its low production cost and the ease with which the material is machined by plastic manufacturers.

The name truncated icosidodecahedron, given originally by Johannes Kepler, is misleading. An actual truncation of an icosidodecahedron has rectangles instead of squares. This nonuniform polyhedron is topologically equivalent to the Archimedean solid.

There are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the elongated square gyrobicupola; 15 if the mirror images of two enantiomorphs, the snub cube and snub dodecahedron, are counted separately). Sorted by volume:

1. Cuboctahedron (rhombitetratetrahedron, triangular gyrobicupola)
2. Truncated tetrahedron
3. Snub cube (snub cuboctahedron)
4. Rhombicuboctahedron (small rhombicuboctahedron, elongated square orthobicupola)
5. Truncated octahedron (truncated tetratetrahedron)
6. Truncated cube
7. Icosidodecahedron (pentagonal gyrobirotunda)
8. Snub dodecahedron (snub icosidodecahedron)
9. Rhombicosidodecahedron (small rhombicosidodecahedron)
10. Truncated cuboctahedron (great rhombicuboctahedron)
11. Truncated icosahedron
12. Truncated dodecahedron
13.  Truncated icosidodecahedron (great rhombicosidodecahedron)

The Zome system is especially good at modeling 1-dimensional skeleta of highly symmetric objects in 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean space. The most prominent among these are the five Platonic solids, and the 4-dimensional polytopes related to the 120-cell and the 600-cell.

![rhombicosidodecahedron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/P4-A11-P5.gif?1661164970388) Expansion of either a dodecahedron or an icosahedron creates a rhombicosidodecahedron. 

Johannes Kepler in Harmonices Mundi (1618) named this polyhedron a rhombicosidodecahedron, being short for truncated icosidodecahedral rhombus, with icosidodecahedral rhombus being his name for a rhombic triacontahedron. There are different truncations of a rhombic triacontahedron into a topological rhombicosidodecahedron: Prominently its rectification (left), the one that creates the uniform solid (center), and the rectification of the dual icosidodecahedron (right), which is the core of the dual compound.

It can also be called an expanded or cantellated dodecahedron or icosahedron, from truncation operations on either uniform polyhedron.

Rectified rhombic triacontahedron. In Euclidean geometry, rectification, also known as critical truncation or complete-truncation is the process of truncating a polytope by marking the midpoints of all its edges, and cutting off its vertices at those points. The resulting polytope will be bounded by vertex figure facets and the rectified facets of the original polytope.

Relative lengths of Zometool struts (s0, s1, s2 for s = g, b, r, y). The ratios s2/s1 = s1/s0 = Phi for all s. 

Note difference between equilateral (g-g-g and b-b-b) and isosceles (y-y-b) triangles.
